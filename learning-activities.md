Learning in this course depends on reflective practice and open collaboration. 
To develop professional competencies through project work, you will engage in 
a variety of learning activities with peers, course instructor, and faculty 
advisor. 

The project work will unfold iteratively, with regular feedback loops. It will 
encompass:
* Research and development of computing artifacts that accomplish the 
project/thesis objectives
* Writing of your project paper or thesis manuscript that describes your work 
and outcomes. 

Your project work will also include:
* collaboration with peers
* reflections on your best possible self, academic commitment, openness to 
experience, and computing professional identity
* regular interactions with and feedback from your faculty advisor and course 
instructor.

### Class Meetings (10%)
The course semester has 15 weeks with five 2-hour scheduled class meetings. 
These class meetings are structured to create a learning environment 
supportive of your project work. Your responsibility is to be on time, 
participate in class discussion, share your progress, give feedback, ask 
questions, and reflect on your learning and project work. 

### Reflections (5%)
To be written.

### Class Communication (priceless)
Discord platform and course-specific channels are used for general or 
category-focused discussions (texting, voice,  and video chat) among all class 
members. 

### Writing Artifacts (15%)
Writing and revising drafts of your project paper or thesis manuscript is an 
iterative process with three milestones:
* Outline (5%), due Feb 18, midnight
* First draft (5%), March 11, midnight
* Almost final draft (5%), April 29, midnight. 

You'll develop these drafts using the Overleaf platform and the Overleaf 
project set up for your project paper/thesis manuscript. The Overleaf project 
will be shared with your faculty advisor for easy communication and 
collaboration. The course instructor will guide you through this writing 
process and evaluate the three instances of drafting your project paper/thesis 
manuscript. 

### Work Progress (10%)
Weekly progress outlines (or reports) using GitHub org associated with this 
course (or other means) will help you plan your work, prepare for your 
meetings with your faculty advisor, and manage project development activities. 
Your faculty advisor will assess your work progress.

### Presentation (10%)
You'll present your master’s project or thesis to your Master’s Project 
Committee and peers on May 6-7, 2021. Presentations are open to the public and 
announced to the department community. A presentation announcement includes 
project/thesis title and author, presentation date, location, and abstract. 
Copies of the announcement are posted on the 1st floor and communicated via 
email to all graduate students and department faculty members. Committee 
members will consult on their evaluation of your presentation.

### Computing Artifacts (25%)
The GitHub org  associated with this course, <https://github.com/master-projects-theses> hosts the remote repositories of the project/thesis 
computing artifacts you develop and manage using GitHub platform tools (e.g., 
Kanban project board, issue tracker) and git feature branch workflow. Your 
faculty advisor will evaluate this component of your project. 

### Project Paper/Thesis Manuscript (30%)
Your project/thesis committee will evaluate the project paper/thesis 
manuscript.
