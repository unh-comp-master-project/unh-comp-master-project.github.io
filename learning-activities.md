Learning in this course depends on:
- Taking full responsibility for your own learning and project development activities
- Regular and timely consultation with your project/thesis advisor and course instructor
- Participation in the scheduled class meetings
- Steady progress to achieve the planned learning milestones.
  
The project development work will unfold iteratively, with regular feedback loops. It will 
encompass:
* Research and development of computing artifacts that accomplish the 
project/thesis objectives
* Writing of your project paper or thesis manuscript that describes your work 
and outcomes. 

Your project development work will also include:
* Collaboration with peers
* Regular interactions with and feedback from your project/thesis advisor and course 
instructor.

*Note*: Whether you are in the Master's Project or Master's Thesis course, we 
will refer to your work in the course as **project development work**. The final artifact 
that documents your project devekionment work is a **project paper** for the Master's Project 
course or **thesis manuscript** for the Master's Thesis course.

### Class Communication (priceless)
**Discord** platform and channels are used for general or topic-focused 
discussions (texting, voice,  and video chat) among all class members. 
**Zoom** sessions are used for the scheduled class meetings. We'll use, discover, 
and share tools that these platforms have to maximize the effectiveness of our 
communication.

### Reflections (5%)
There will be four learning activities during the semester in which you will 
reflect on your affective and cognitive well-being, academic commitment, 
openness to experience, and your computing professional identity. 

The first three reflections will also include a short 20-minute writing 
session. Known as the **best possible self**, this kind of reflection has been 
shown to facilitate a positive relationship between the learner's well-being 
and their academic achievement. By thinking and writing about your best 
possible self, you learn about yourself, what you want in life, and how to 
restructure your priorities. It can also help you increase your sense of 
control over your life by highlighting what you need to do to achieve your 
goals.

### Class Meetings (10%)
The course semester has 15 weeks with **five 2-hour scheduled class meetings**. 
These class meetings are structured to create a learning environment 
supportive of your project work. Your responsibility is to be on time, 
participate in class discussion, share your progress, give feedback, ask 
questions, and reflect on your learning and project work. 

Course instructor evaluates this course requirement.

### Writing Artifacts (20%)
Writing and revising drafts of your project paper or thesis manuscript is an 
iterative process with three milestones:
* Outline (4%)
* First draft (8%)
* Almost final draft (8%). 

You'll develop these drafts using the **Overleaf** platform and the Overleaf 
project set up for your project paper/thesis manuscript. The Overleaf project 
will be shared with your project/thesis advisor for easy communication and 
collaboration. 

The course instructor will guide you through this writing 
process and evaluate the three iterations of drafting your project paper/thesis 
manuscript. 

### Work Progress (10%)
- Weekly progress uses **OneDrive**, **GitHub Project Board**, or other means of sharing to help you
  - Plan your work
  - Prepare for your meetings with your project/thesis advisor
  - Manage project development activities. 

Your project/thesis advisor will assess your work progress.

### Presentation (10%)
You'll present your masterâ€™s project or thesis to your peers, project/thesis advisors, 
and other guests. Thesis committee members will participate in the presentation 
of the master's theses. Presentations are open to the public and 
announced to the department community. A presentation announcement includes 
project/thesis title and author, presentation date, location, and abstract. 
Copies of the announcement are posted on the 1st floor and communicated via 
email to all graduate students and department faculty members. 

Course instructor and your project/thesis advisor will assess your presentation.

### Computing Artifacts (20%)
The **GitHub** org  associated with this course, <https://github.com/master-projects-theses> hosts the remote repositories of the project/thesis computing artifacts you develop and manage using the **GitHub Project Board** and **git feature branch workflow**. 

Your project/thesis advisor will evaluate this component of your project. 

### Project Paper or Thesis Manuscript (30%)
*Master's Project*: Your project advisor will evaluate your project paper.

*Master's Thesis*: Your thesis advisor and thesis committee members will evaluate your thesis manuscript.
