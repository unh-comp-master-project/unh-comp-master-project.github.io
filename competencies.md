### Learning Goals
The purpose of the course is for you to learn to:
* Conduct a research and development (R&D) study in the Information Technolog 
(IT) field
* Apply IT concepts, computational approaches, and computing tools in the 
process of developing, evaluating, and writing about a project that addresses 
an authentic issue or problem of interest
* Gain professional experience and develop your own computing professional 
identity through practicing professional competencies.

In addition, a Master's Thesis will give you the opportunity to:
* Choose an original topic in consultation with your thesis advisor
* Conduct literature review to delimit the scope of the topic
* Identify and apply appropriate research methods
* Write the  thesis manuscript following the UNH Graduate School guidelines to  
document all thesis R&D work

Once the thesis is presented to the thesis committe and successfully defended,
