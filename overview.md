### Purpose
The Master's Project gives you the opportunity to
* conduct an investigative study in the Information Technology (IT) field and
* apply IT concepts, principles and practices to address an authentic issue or
problem of interest
* gain professional experience specific to an academic R&D lab involving student fellows and faculty advisors.

### Advising and Support
You will register in the **COMP 898  Master's Project** course by selecting the
course section that has your project advisor listed as course instructor or
co-instructor.

#### Course Instructor
The course instructor is responsible for helping you:
* engage with peers in the project work process through five scheduled class
meetings that coincide with important project milestones
* write the project paper iteratively, from one-page outline to the first full  
draft and then "almost final" draft, to produce the project paper's final
version
*  use effective tools to support the test-driven and incremental process of:
    * managing your project work activities using the GitHub Kanban project
    board and
    * progressively documenting your work while drafting the project paper
    using the Overleaf platform
* present your project to peers, committee members, and other guests in the
second to last week of the term.

#### Faculty Project Advisor
The faculty project advisor is responsible for helping you:
* define the goal, objectives, scope, and outcomes of your project
* select your project committee
* identify and use appropriate methods and tools
* meet regularly to give you prompt feedback
* review project artifacts and project paper drafts and final version.

#### Project Committee
The project committee is chaired by your faculty project advisor and includes
two other members you select in consultation with your project advisor. Two
committee members are faculty in the Applied Engineering and Sciences
Department. The third committee member can be another academic (from UNH or
external to UNH), or a professional whose expertise is relevant to your
project.

Project committee members are required to:
* participate in your final presentation
* review your project paper
* give evaluative feedback to your project advisor.

The committee has to be determined no later than the end of the second week of
the semester.

### Project Selection
The project topic, overarching goal, scope, and expected outcomes are
determined by you and your project advisor based on:
* your interest, professional experience, and level of preparation and
readiness
* expertise and research agenda of your project advisor.  

Different projects make use of different research methods.
To learn more about research methods in computing, see Serge Demeyer's 2011 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance [research methods in Computer Science tutorial](https://unh.box.com/s/ubanos64ju4emwsh7m8ab8l5auedi2ub) and [research methods slide presentation](https://win.uantwerpen.be/~sdemey/Tutorial_ResearchMethods/ResearchMethds01_MethodsOvervw.pdf).

### Course Registration and Grading
Upon successful completion of your project, the course instructor, your project
advisor, and project committee will evaluate your project. Your project
advisor will submit the final letter grade.

If you make progress with the project work but don't finalize the project at
the end of the term, the project advisor will submit an IA grade (meaning that
you will continue your work the following semester). To continue and complete the project in the following semester you will enroll in the **GRAD 900 Master's Continuing Research** course with the approval of your project advisor. GRAD 900 course carries no credit, but ensures that you will receive advising and
feedback from your project advisor, course instructor, and committee members.
You will also participate in the scheduled course meeting and the project
presentation session at the end of the semester.

If no or insufficient progress is made with the project work, the project advisor submits an **F grade** , and you will need to retake and pass the course in
order to fulfill the program requirements.

If you need to take time off from the graduate program of studies for personal
reasons, you may sign up for **GRAD 800 Continuing Enrollment**, which carries
zero credits and allows you to continue to be officially matriculated in the
program of study. There is no project advisor supervision during GRAD 800
enrollment.
