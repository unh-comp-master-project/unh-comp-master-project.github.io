### Purpose
The Master's Project or Thesis gives you the opportunity to
* conduct a research and development study in the Information Technology (IT) field
* apply IT concepts, principles and practices to address an authentic issue or
problem of interest
* gain professional experience specific to an academic R&D lab involving student fellows and faculty advisors.

In addition, a Master's Thesis will give you the opportunity to:
* choose an original topic in consultation with their thesis advisor
* conduct literature review to delimit the scope of the topic
* identify appropriate research methods
* write the  thesis manuscript following the UNH Graduate School guidelines to document all thesis R&D work

Once the thesis is presented to the thesis committe and successfully defended, the publication 
will be submitted to the UNH library for archiving. The thesis option is most appropriate for students who desire to develop additional research skills and plan on pursuing a Ph.D. or 
seek a career in research.

### Advising and Support
You will register in the **COMP 898  Master's Project** course or **COMP 899 Master's Thesis** 
by selecting the course section that has your advisor listed as course instructor or
co-instructor.

#### Course Instructor
The course instructor is responsible for helping you:
* engage with peers in the project/thesis work process through five scheduled class
meetings that coincide with important project/thesis milestones
* write the project paper or thesis manuscdript iteratively, from one-page outline to the first 
full  draft and then "almost final" draft, to produce the project pape or thesis final
version
*  use effective tools to support the test-driven and incremental process of:
    * managing your project/thesis work activities using the GitHub Kanban project
    board and
    * progressively documenting your work while drafting the project paper or thesis 
    manuscript using the Overleaf platform
* present your project or thesis to peers, committee members, and other guests in the
second to last week of the term.

#### Faculty Advisor
The faculty advisor is responsible for helping you:
* define the goal, objectives, scope, and outcomes of your project/thesis
* select your project/thesis committee
* identify and use appropriate methods and tools
* meet regularly to give you prompt feedback
* review project/thesis artifacts and project paper/thesis drafts and final version.

#### Project/Thesis Committee
The project/thesis committee is chaired by your advisor and includes
two other members you select in consultation with your advisor. Two
committee members are faculty in the Applied Engineering and Sciences
Department. The third committee member can be another academic (from UNH or
external to UNH), or a professional whose expertise is relevant to your
project/thesis.

Project/thesis committee members are required to:
* participate in your final presentation
* review your project paper or thesis manuscript
* give evaluative feedback to your project/thesis.

The committee has to be determined no later than the end of the second week of
the semester.

### Project/Thesis Topic Selection
The project/thesis topic, overarching goal, scope, and expected outcomes are
determined by you and your advisor based on:
* your interest, professional experience, and level of preparation and
readiness
* expertise and research agenda of your advisor.  

Different projects/theses make use of different research methods.
To learn more about research methods in computing, see Serge Demeyer's 2011 IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance [research methods in Computer Science tutorial](https://unh.box.com/s/ubanos64ju4emwsh7m8ab8l5auedi2ub) and [research methods slide presentation](https://win.uantwerpen.be/~sdemey/Tutorial_ResearchMethods/ResearchMethds01_MethodsOvervw.pdf).

### Course Registration and Grading
Upon successful completion of your project/thesis, the course instructor, your 
advisor, and project/thesis committee will evaluate your project/thesis. Your 
advisor will submit the final letter grade.

If you make progress with the project/thesis work but don't finalize the project/thesis at
the end of the term, your advisor will submit an IA grade (meaning that
you will continue your work the following semester). To continue and complete the project/thesis in the following semester you will enroll in the **GRAD 900 Master's Continuing Research** course with the approval of your  advisor. GRAD 900 course carries no credit, but ensures that you will receive advising and
feedback from your  advisor, course instructor, and committee members.
You will also participate in the scheduled course meeting and the project 
presentation or thesis defense session at the end of the semester.

If no or insufficient progress is made with your work, your advisor submits an **F grade** , and you will need to retake and pass the course in
order to fulfill the program requirements.

If you need to take time off from the graduate program of studies for personal
reasons, you may sign up for **GRAD 800 Continuing Enrollment**, which carries
zero credits and allows you to continue to be officially matriculated in the
program of study. There is no advisor supervision during GRAD 800
enrollment.
