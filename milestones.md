### **Abstract**

Summarize in 250-300 words:

1. Problem, situation, or issue that the project will address and why it is important
2. Objectives or what the project will accomplish
3. Approach of the research and development process, including tools, data sets, architectural approach, or methods used to do the project
4. Results as evidence of the success of the project work
5. Evaluation or interpretation of the results and concluding remarks. 

Guidelines

* The abstract is written in paragraph form with no itemized list or literature references. 
* All five items are appropriately balanced size-wise. The first two items must be less than half of the abstract size. 
* When preparing the very first draft, items 4 and 5 describe what you expect, since the work has just started.
* The value of the abstract, in all its iterations, is to be the ***map*** that guides your weekly project tasks. 
* **First Draft Deadline**
  * The student presents the very first draft of the abstract to the project advisor for review and comment no later than the 2nd week of the term (Fall, Spring, or Summer). 
* Writing the abstract is an iterative process. There is a discovery component of the project work, which might cause unexpected "turns" in your project development journey. Regular abstract's revisions will capture changes or new directions your project work will take.

### **Committee**

It is the responsibility of the student to assemble a committee of experts who have agreed to serve on the committee. The project advisor can assist the student in establishing the committee. The committee consists of at three people who are well qualified to judge the technical merits of the project. At least two members of the committee are residential faculty in the Applied Engineering and Sciences Department, including the faculty who serves as project advisor.

**Deadline**: The student communicates the committee's composition to the project advisor no later than the 4th week of the Fall or Spring term or 3nd week of the Summer term.

### **Proposal**

This is a 4 - 6 page paper (not including title page and abstract) that elaborates on and includes:

- Introduction
  - General problem or issue to be addressed, including the context or opportunity for topic selection and the importance/significance of the problem/issue
  - Most relevant previous research and development (R\&D) on the topic
- Learning Outcomes
  - Contribution of the project to the student's educational goals and how this project will enhance understanding of the field
  - Contribution of the project to the student's long-term career goals
- Project Objectives
  - Concrete contributions of the project to addressing the problem/issue: what will the project work accomplish?
  - Tangible product(s) of the project
- Approach or Methodology
  - Methods, procedures, or theories that will be used to address the R\&D topic
  - Tools, data sets, techniques, frameworks, and/or practices that will be studied and applied in order to do the project work
- Location
  - Principal location of project work (school, lab, sponsoring organization)
- Preparation and Experience
  - Preparation and qualification needed to undertake the project (coursework, job experience, other R\&D experiences)
  - Plans to further prepare while undertaking the project
- Project advisor and project committee members
  - Names, titles/positions, emails
- Timeline and Planned Activities
  - Time allotted to each portion of the project (week by week and stage by stage)
  - Brief explanation of the R\&D activities planned for each week and stage.

**Deadline**: The student presents the project proposal to the project advisor for review and comment no later than the 4th week of the Fall or Spring term or the 3rd week of the Summer term.

### **Mid-semester progress report**

A progress report on the project work is due mid-semester to get feedback from the project advisor, resolve critical issues, finalize plans for project completion, and discuss any other conditions encountered during project work to date.

**Deadline**: Mid-semester (7th week in the  Fall/Spring term or 5th week Summer term)

### **First draft of project paper**

A first full draft of the project paper is presented to the project advisor for review and comment with sufficient time for revision prior to the project submission deadline.

**Deadline**: No later than the 10th week of a Fall or Spring term or 7th week of a summer term.

### **Project Presentation**
Projects must be presented to the Master&#39;s Project Committee. Project presentations are open to the public and announced to the department community. Project presentation announcement includes project title and author, presentation date, location, and abstract. Hard copies of the announcement are posted on the 1st floor. The Department emails the project presentation announcement to all graduate students and department faculty members.

**Deadline**: Presentations are typically scheduled towards the end of the semester, before the finals week in Fall and Spring terms and mid-August in the Summer term. Project presentation must be scheduled and confirmed by all committee members upon submission of the project proposal, no later than the 4th week in the Fall/Spring term or 3rd week of the Summer term.

Project presentation is announced to the Department community no later than one week before the scheduled presentation.

**Oral Presentation Format**:
The duration of the presentation is no longer than 30 minutes: 
* 20-25 minutes slide presentation and brief demo (when appropriate)
* followed by 5-10 minutes discussion. 
This format is similar to a conference paper presentation. 

**Slides Presentation Organization and Guidelines**:
Presentation slides must be judiciously designed and include exactly 8 slides
* 1 **title** slide (1 min)
 * Has project title, author, project advisor, and Date
 * You briefly describe the issue/problem the project addresses
* 1**project objectives** slide (2 min)
 * Has clearly stated and very specific objectives presented in a bulleted list
 * You start with introducing  the goal of the project and why it is importnat
 * Continue with presenting the objectives
* 2 **approach/methodology** slides (5 min)
 * Has tools, data sets, frameworks, techniques, and other resources needed to do the project work
 * You explain how you did the project and how you achieve the project's objectives
* 3 **results** slides (10 min)
 * Has evidence of the project deliverables, components, and functionality
 * You present and demonstrate what the project's artifacts are and what they accomplish
* 1 **evaluation/discussion** slide (2 min)
 * Has evaluation of the results
 * You explain to what degree the project achieved its objectives, including limitatinos and constraints
