    <p>A student who seeks to graduate with the Master's Project option must register in the <strong>COMP 898  Master's Project</strong> course under the supervision of a faculty project advisor. Project work begins in the semester where all required course work in the program will be completed or after it has been completed. Upon successful completion of the project, the project advisor submits a <strong>letter</strong> grade for the course.</p>

<p>If progress is made with the project work, but the project is not finalized at the end of the term, the project advisor submits an <strong>IA grade</strong>. To to continue and complete the project in the following term the student enrolls in the <strong>GRAD 900 Master's Continuing Research</strong> course with the approval of the project advisor. GRAD 900 course carries no credit but ensures that the student receives advising from their project advisor. Upon successful completion of the project, the project advisor submits a <strong>letter</strong> grade for the COMP 898 course.</p>

<p>If no or insufficient progress is made with the project work, the project advisor submits an <strong>F grade</strong> , and the student will need to retake and pass the course in order to fulfill the program requirements.</p>

<p>Students who need to take time off for personal reasons may sign up for GRAD 800 Continuing Enrollment, which carries zero credits and allows students to continue to be officially a matriculated in the program of study. There is no project advisor supervision during GRAD 800 enrollment.</p>

<h3 id="intent-and-objectives"><strong>Intent and Objectives</strong></h3>
<p>The intent of the Master's Project is for the student to apply the concepts, principles and practices they have learned to address an authentic problem of interest to them and their project advisor and conduct an investigative study in the Information Technology field. The specific approach to completing the requirements of the project depends on the nature of the project: computing system development, experimental research, or case study. Through the Master's Project, students may gain work experience in an industry setting, industry/university collaboration, or university research lab. The Master's project should have well-defined objectives or outcomes.</p>

<p>The student demonstrates the outcomes of the project work by preparing a technical paper suitable for submission to a peer-review conference or technical journal.</p>
