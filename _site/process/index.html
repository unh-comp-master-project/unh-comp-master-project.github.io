<p><em><strong>Project Topic</strong></em></p>

<p>The student identifies a suitable topic and project advisor in the Applied Engineering and Sciences Department who agrees to supervise the project work. The student will contact the project advisor and make arrangements to begin. If a student wishes to develop a project topic on their own, it is their responsibility to identify a project advisor who agrees to supervise their work. In no case should work on the project begin until a faculty project advisor has agreed to supervise the project work.</p>

<p><em><strong>Project Abstract</strong></em></p>

<p>The student prepares an abstract of the project paper and have the abstract approved by the project advisor. This may make take several iterations. Students are encouraged to seek out their project advisor to obtain ideas and guidance to ensure that both the student and project advisor agree that the project paper described in the abstract will be suitable deliverable for the project. Depending on the topic and methodology of the project, domain experts outside the Applied Engineering and Sciences Department could be selected to supplement the mentoring provided by the faculty project advisor.</p>

<p><em><strong>Project Work</strong></em></p>

<p>Throughout the project, it is the responsibility of the student to obtain input and guidance from their project advisor, as required. A student may choose to conduct their project work at a company. If the project has a commercial value to the company involved, a non-disclosure and development agreement may need to be put in place before beginning of the project.</p>

<p><em><strong>Grading</strong></em></p>

<p>The final project paper will be submitted to the project advisor and project committee. For a paper to receive a <strong>grade of A</strong> , it must be judged by the project advisor and project committee as suitable for submission to a conference or journal. Papers that are not well done but do rise to that standard will be assigned a <strong>grade of B</strong>. Lesser papers will be graded accordingly.</p>
