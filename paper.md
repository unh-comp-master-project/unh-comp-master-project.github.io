The project paper is a **six-page, two-column conference** paper complying with the ACM **sigconf** conference paper submission. See Section 2. *Workflow and Templates* and subsection ***LaTeX Collaborative Authoring Tool on Overleaf Platform*** on [https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions](https://www.acm.org/publications/authors/submissions). 

_ACM_ has partnered with [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-conference-proceedings-new-master-template/pnrfvrrdbfwt#.Wqz3xoJG36A), a free cloud-based, collaborative authoring tool, to provide an _ACM_ LaTeX authoring template, if you choose to use LaTeX templates.

Note that the paper size requirements are equivalent with a 25-page, double-spaced paper. The Computing Program has an Overleaf license that has review and version control features. Overleaf projects for your project papers will be created in that account to allow collaboration between you and your committee members. To get started, get the zip file that has the Overlearf project template you'll use to create your Overleaf project paper. 

The project paper will include, at a minimum, the normal elements associated with a research project:

- Introduction
- Project Objectives
- Approach, Methods, Tools
- Results
- Evaluation and Discussion
- Conclusions
