### GitHub ###
A remote repo named `lastname-firstname` (using your last name and first name) 
that has an empty README.md file is the starting point for managing the 
development of your project and timely communication with your project advisor 
about your progress. 
* A tech consultant will set up the remote repo before the start of the 
semester, ask for your GitHub user name, and send you and your project advisor 
an invite to become the remote repo maintainers.
* Clone the remote repo on your machine in the root folder of your project
    * Use `git` version control for all
