### Project Work Outline
In one page draft the outline of your project wrok. Organize your outline in five sections. In each section address the questinos below. 

1. What do you plan to investigate? What's the object of your investigation? 
2. What will you investigate? What is the overarching goal of the project? 
What objectives do you plan to accomplish in order to meet the overall goal?
3. How do you plan to carry out the project work? What are the milestones and artifacts of the development process? What methods, tools, and/or data sets 
will you use? 
4. What result do you expect your project work to produce?
5. How will you evaluate the result?

You'll need to come up with suggestive names for the section titles. 

Some Guidelines

* The outline is written in paragraph form.
* The sections are appropriately balanced size-wise. For excample, the first 
two sections cannot be more than half of the outline. 
* The section you might be more comfortable starting with is section #3. This is because you might have a clearer idea of the work you want to do. 
* The section that give me the most trouble is section #2. To clearly 
and accurately articulate the actual objectives of the project work, we need 
to have a good understanding of 
  * what we want do (section #1) and 
  * how we want to do it (section #3)
* Envisioning the result of our project work (section #4) will also help with 
drafting better objectives (section #2)
* Writing the outline is an iterative process. Don't try to write it in one
writing session. 

Keep in mind that most likely there will be discovery component in your project 
work. It might cause unexpected the development process. Regular outline's revisions will capture those changes or new directions and will help with 
preparing the first full draft of your project paper. 


### Project Paper/Thesis Manuscript

#### Overleaf Project 
Overleaf, a cloud-based collaborative authoring tool, is used to draft your 
project paper/thesis manuscipt. The Computing Program has an Overleaf license 
that has review, track changes, and version control features. 

Overleaf projects set up before the start of the semester are the places where 
you draft your paper project/thesis manuscript, collaborate wtih course 
instructor and faculty advisor, get feedback and iteratively develop the final 
version. 

To get started:
* COMP 898/899
  * Accept invite to the Overleaf project that has the starter files for 
  your project paper or thesis manuscript
* GRAD 900
  * It means you already have an Overleaf project set up that has last 
  semester's draft of your project paper/thesis manuscript.

#### Formatting
Guidelines for formattting your thesis manuscript are maintained by the 
Graduate School. See manual in UNH Box at <https://unh.app.box.com/v/thesis-manual>. 

The project paper formatting uses the ACM conference paper LaTeX template. 
_ACM_ has partnered with [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-conference-proceedings-new-master-template/pnrfvrrdbfwt#.Wqz3xoJG36A)to provide 
an _ACM_ LaTeX authoring template. We have adapted the template and created an 
Overleaf starter project to wchih you and your advisor have access. 

#### Iterative Development


### Presentation
Master's projects and theses are presented to Master's Project Committee. 
Presentations are open to the public and announced to the department community. 
A presentation announcement includes project/thesis title and author, 
presentation date, location, and abstract. Copies of the announcement are posted 
on the 1st floor and communicated via email to all graduate students and 
department faculty members.

Presentations are scheduled in the 2nd to last week of the semester. 
Presentations' schedule is communicated to the committee 
members by the course instructor. 

#### Project Presentation Format
The duration of the project presentation is no longer than 30 minutes:
* 20-25 minutes slide presentation and brief demo (when appropriate)
* followed by 5-10 minutes discussion.

#### Slides Organization and Guidelines
Presentation slides must be judiciously designed and include exactly 8 slides

| Slide(s) | Number | Duration | Content |
|---|---|---|---|
| title | 1 | 1 min | Has project title, author, project advisor, and Date. Briefly describe the issue/problem the project addresses |
| aims | 1 | 2 min | Has clearly stated and very specific objectives presented in a bulleted list. You start with introducing  the goal of the project and why it is importnat. Continue with presenting the objectives |
| approach | 2-3  | 5 min |  Has tools, data sets, frameworks, techniques, and other resources needed to do the project work. You explain how you did the project and how you achieve the project's objectives |
| results | 3-4 | 10 min | Has evidence of the project deliverables, components, and functionality. You present and demonstrate what the project's artifacts are and what they accomplish |
| evaluation | 1 | 2 min | Has evaluation of the results. You explain to what degree the project achieved its objectives, including limitatinos and constraints. |
