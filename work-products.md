### Project Work Outline
#### Organization
Draft the outline of your project work. The content of the outline is organized in sections. Limit the overal size of the outline to 1-3 paragraphs per 
section. 

In each section address the questions below. 
1. What will you investigate? What is the overarching goal of the project work? 
2. What are the sub-goals (or objectives) of your investigation? 
3. How do you plan to carry out the project work?
 - What are the milestones and artifacts of the development process?
 - What methods, tools, and/or data sets will you use? 
5. What results do you expect your project work to produce?
6. How will you evaluate the results?

You'll need to come up with suggestive names for the section titles. 

#### Some Guidelines

* The outline is written in paragraph form.
* The content you write in corresponding sections are appropriately balanced size-wise. For excample, the first 
two sections cannot be more than half of the outline. 
* Section 3 (approach, methods, tools) is a good starting point. This is because you probably have a clearer idea of the work you want 
to do. 
* The section that is not as easy as it seems is Section 2, the objectives or clear sub-goals that will lead to achieving the overarching goal of the project.  To clearly and accurately articulate the actual objectives of the project work, you need to have a good understanding of: 
  * What you want do, Section #1, overarching goal of your study
  * How you want to do it, Section #3, approach, methods, tools.
* Envisioning the results of our project work, Section 4, will also help with drafting better objectives. 
* Writing the outline is an iterative process, not necessarily linear. Don't try to write it in one writing session. 

Keep in mind that most likely there will be a discovery component in your 
project work. It might cause unexpected turns in the development process. 
Regular revisions of the project outline will capture those changes or new 
directions and will help you with preparing the first full draft of your 
project paper.

### Project Paper First Draft
The first draft of the project paper will have the following content 
based on your review of and updates to similar content in your outline:
* Reviewed/updated **overarching goal of the study/investigation** carried out 
by your project work thatin Section 1.
* Reviewed/updated **project work objectives** (or subgoals or milestones) of 
the study you have planned in order to achieve the study's goal (Section 2). This is NOT 
to be confused with the results of project. This is where you say HOW you've reached the study's goal. 
* Reviewed/updated **project work approach** in Section 3.
* Reviewed/updated **project work results** in Section 4.
* Draf of the **evaluation of the results** based on project work objectives and 
evaluation criteria and evaluation methods you describe in this section. 
* Do NOT write the abstract yet. You are not ready to knowledgeably synthesize in 
300 words the entire project paper.

Thesis first draft is organized in chapters. Different from the project paper, a thesis first draft must have a chapter on the relevant literature, theoretical background, and what is known about the particular topic of the thesis. Therefore, the thesis draft also has a more extensive Referencees section.

### Almost Final Draft (project or thesis)
* **Updated title**
  * Must be about the STUDY, not the primary result of your study
* **Abstract draft**
  * See feedback to the  first full draft. 
  * I recommend you do this AFTER you have the other sections/chapters drafted. 
  Size: 300-350 words.
* **Introducctory section(s) (or chapters)** 
  * Describe the ***problem/issue*** your are studying
    * If your study is based on an existing system, make sure that your study 
    is NOT REPEATING stuff from the previous study.
  * Outline why your study, if successful, will be beneficial. 
    * What are the ***expected  impacts*** of your STUDY (NOT the benefits of 
    the primary result of your study)
* State the ***objectives*** of your STUDY 
  * Objectives are NOT to be confused with results. They are what you have 
  planned in order to achieve the study's goal. 
* **Elaborate on the objectives**: at minimum, brief paragraph for each 
objective.
* You might include a description of **related work** in this segment of your 
project paper or thesis manuscript 
  * Consult with your project advisor about it. 
  * This is a required chapter for the thesis manuscript.
* Conclude the section(s) with one paragraph that describes the organization of 
the rest of the document. 
  * In a thesis manuscript, this can be a separate section.
* **Tentative size**
  * Project Paper: title + abstract + introductory section(s): 
    * 20% of the paper
  * Thesis Paper: introductory sections: around 20% - 25% of the manuscript.
    * It depends how critical related work is to your study. 
* **Approach**
  * Describe **HOW** you conducted the STUDY.
  * Using a logical order of the study's objectives, describe in more detail 
  the ACTUAL work carried out.
  * Do NOT make it into mini presentations of various methods, tools, 
  techniques you've used. 
  * The focus should be on **explaining WHY** and **HOW** you apply a specific 
  method or use a specific tool, model, algorithm in your study
  * **Tentative size**: 
    * Paper: 30% of the paper
    * Thesis: 20-30% of the manuscript
  * **Results** 
    * Present **WHAT** your project work produced that shows to what extent 
    you have achieved the OBJECTIVES
    * Illustrate **artifacts** that evidence the outcomes of the project work. 
    * **Explain** what the artifacts mean: why they are important/critical to 
  your STUDY. 
  * **Tentative size**: 
    * Paper: 30% 
    * Thesis: 20-30%
* **Evaluation of the results**
  * It is based on study objectives and evaluation criteria of the results
  * Present the evaluation approach based on which you could describe the 
  "goodness" of the results
  * **Tentative size**: 
    * Paper: 12-15%
    * Thesis: 10-20%
* **Conclusion**
  * Similar to the abstract, but uses past tense and focuses more on the 
  results and evaluation. 
  * **Tentative size**: 
    * Paper/Thesis: 5-10% (paper: less than a column)
* **References**
  * Paper/Thesis: Separate section/chapter
* **Appendix**
  * Has additional sections for supplementary stuff that gives a more 
  comprehensive view of your work and results.

### Presentation
Master's projects and theses are presented to Master's Project Committee. 
Presentations are open to the public and announced to the department community. 
A presentation announcement includes project/thesis title and author, 
presentation date, location, and abstract. Copies of the announcement are posted 
on the 1st floor and communicated via email to all graduate students and 
department faculty members.

Presentations are scheduled in the 2nd to last week of the semester. 
Presentations' schedule is communicated to the committee 
members by the course instructor. 

#### Project Presentation Format
The duration of the project presentation is 25 - 35 minutes:
* 20-25 minutes slide presentation and brief demo (5-10)
* followed by 5-10 minutes discussion.

#### Slides Organization and Guidelines
Presentation slides must be judiciously designed and include exactly 8 slides

## How to Develop Projet Paper or Thesis Manuscript

#### Overleaf Project 
Overleaf, a cloud-based collaborative authoring tool, is used to draft your 
project paper/thesis manuscipt. The Computing Program has an Overleaf license 
that has review, track changes, and version control features. 

Overleaf projects set up before the start of the semester are the places where 
you draft your paper project/thesis manuscript, collaborate wtih course 
instructor and project/thesis advisor, get feedback and iteratively develop the final 
version. 

To get started:
* COMP 898/899
  * Accept invite to the Overleaf project that has the starter files for 
  your project paper or thesis manuscript
* GRAD 900
  * It means you already have an Overleaf project set up that has last 
  semester's draft of your project paper/thesis manuscript.

#### Formatting
Guidelines for formattting your thesis manuscript are maintained by the 
Graduate School. See manual in UNH Box at <https://unh.app.box.com/v/thesis-manual>. 

The project paper formatting uses the ACM conference paper template. 
- [Word template](https://authors.acm.org/proceedings/production-information/preparing-your-article-with-microsoft-word)
- [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-conference-proceedings-new-master-template/pnrfvrrdbfwt#.Wqz3xoJG36A)to provide an _ACM_ LaTeX authoring template. We have adapted the template and created an Overleaf starter project to wchih you and your advisor have access.
