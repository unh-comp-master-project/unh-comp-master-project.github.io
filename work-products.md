### Project Paper/Thesis Manuscript

#### Overleaf Project 
Overleaf, a cloud-based collaborative authoring tool, is used to draft your 
project paper/thesis manuscipt. The Computing Program has an Overleaf license 
that has review, track changes, and version control features. 

Overleaf projects set up before the start of the semester are the places where 
you draft your paper project/thesis manuscript, collaborate wtih course 
instructor and faculty advisor, get feedback and iteratively develop the final 
version. 

To get started:
* COMP 898/899
  * Accept invite to the Overleaf project that has the starter files for 
  your project paper or thesis manuscript
* GRAD 900
  * It means you already have an Overleaf project set up that has last 
  semester's draft of your project paper/thesis manuscript.

#### Formatting
Guidelines for formattting your thesis manuscript are maintained by the 
Graduate School. See manual in UNH Box at <https://unh.app.box.com/v/thesis-manual>. 

The project paper formatting uses the ACM conference paper LaTeX template. 
_ACM_ has partnered with [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-conference-proceedings-new-master-template/pnrfvrrdbfwt#.Wqz3xoJG36A)to provide 
an _ACM_ LaTeX authoring template. We have adapted the template and created an 
Overleaf starter project to wchih you and your advisor have access. 

#### Iterative Development



### Presentation
Master's projects and theses are presented to Master's Project Committee. 
Presentations are open to the public and announced to the department community. 
A presentation announcement includes project/thesis title and author, 
presentation date, location, and abstract. Copies of the announcement are posted 
on the 1st floor and communicated via email to all graduate students and 
department faculty members.

Presentations are scheduled in the 2nd to last week of the semester. 
Presentations' schedule is communicated to the committee 
members by the course instructor. 

#### Project Presentation Format
The duration of the project presentation is no longer than 30 minutes:
* 20-25 minutes slide presentation and brief demo (when appropriate)
* followed by 5-10 minutes discussion.

#### Slides Organization and Guidelines
Presentation slides must be judiciously designed and include exactly 8 slides

| Slide(s) | Number | Duration | Content |
|---|---|---|---|
| title | 1 | 1 min | Has project title, author, project advisor, and Date. Briefly describe the issue/problem the project addresses |
| aims | 1 | 2 min | Has clearly stated and very specific objectives presented in a bulleted list. You start with introducing  the goal of the project and why it is importnat. Continue with presenting the objectives |
| approach | 2-3  | 5 min |  Has tools, data sets, frameworks, techniques, and other resources needed to do the project work. You explain how you did the project and how you achieve the project's objectives |
| results | 3-4 | 10 min | Has evidence of the project deliverables, components, and functionality. You present and demonstrate what the project's artifacts are and what they accomplish |
| evaluation | 1 | 2 min | Has evaluation of the results. You explain to what degree the project achieved its objectives, including limitatinos and constraints. |

### Abstract

Summarize in 250-300 words:

1. Problem, situation, or issue that the project will address and why it is important
2. Objectives or what the project will accomplish
3. Approach of the research and development process, including tools, data sets, architectural approach, or methods used to do the project
4. Results as evidence of the success of the project work
5. Evaluation or interpretation of the results and concluding remarks.

Guidelines

* The abstract is written in paragraph form with no itemized list or literature references.
* All five items are appropriately balanced size-wise. The first two items must be less than half of the abstract size.
* When preparing the very first draft, items 4 and 5 describe what you expect, since the work has just started.
* The value of the abstract, in all its iterations, is to be the ***map*** that guides your weekly project tasks.
* **First Draft Deadline**
  * The student presents the very first draft of the abstract to the project advisor for review and comment no later than the 2nd week of the term (Fall, Spring, or Summer).
* Writing the abstract is an iterative process. There is a discovery component of the project work, which might cause unexpected "turns" in your project development journey. Regular abstract's revisions will capture changes or new directions your project work will take.

### Proposal

This is a 4 - 6 page paper (not including title page and abstract) that elaborates on and includes:

- Introduction
  - General problem or issue to be addressed, including the context or opportunity for topic selection and the importance/significance of the problem/issue
  - Most relevant previous research and development (R\&D) on the topic
- Learning Outcomes
  - Contribution of the project to the student's educational goals and how this project will enhance understanding of the field
  - Contribution of the project to the student's long-term career goals
- Project Objectives
  - Concrete contributions of the project to addressing the problem/issue: what will the project work accomplish?
  - Tangible product(s) of the project
- Approach or Methodology
  - Methods, procedures, or theories that will be used to address the R\&D topic
  - Tools, data sets, techniques, frameworks, and/or practices that will be studied and applied in order to do the project work
- Location
  - Principal location of project work (school, lab, sponsoring organization)
- Preparation and Experience
  - Preparation and qualification needed to undertake the project (coursework, job experience, other R\&D experiences)
  - Plans to further prepare while undertaking the project
- Project advisor and project committee members
  - Names, titles/positions, emails
- Timeline and Planned Activities
  - Time allotted to each portion of the project (week by week and stage by stage)
  - Brief explanation of the R\&D activities planned for each week and stage.

**Deadline**: The student presents the project proposal to the project advisor for review and comment no later than the 4th week of the Fall or Spring term or the 3rd week of the Summer term.
